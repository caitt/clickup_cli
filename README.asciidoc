ClickUp CLI
===========

This is a simple app to display tasks from ClickUp service. It is in early
stages of development, so no nice packaging yet and nothing set in stone
yet.

Dependencies
------------

It is written in JavaScript. So it requires Node.js to run. Apart from
that, it combines two packages
https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-table[cli-table] and
https://www.npmjs.com/package/clickup.js[clickup.js].

You can install those using following command:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
npm install cli-table clickup.js
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage
-----

To be able to use it, you need to obtain a personal token from ClickUp and
put it into a configuration file `~/.clickup/config`. This configuration
file is _json_ and you can see the example one bellow.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
{
    "token": "pk_12345678_1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV",
    "sync_always": true
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`token`
^^^^^^^

Your personal token to access ClickUp API.

`sync_always`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With every call update local cache first. Slower, but you don't risk being
out of date.
